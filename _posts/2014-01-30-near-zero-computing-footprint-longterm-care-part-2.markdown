<img src="/assets/globe.png" class="right padded-left" alt="Garland" itemprop="image">In the <a href='http://blog.edentech.net/healthcare/2013/12/04/near-zero-computing-footprint-longterm-care.html'>part 1</a> of this post I discussed the concept of Near Zero Computing Footprint, how to start on a path towards achieving it, and what forms it may take on.  In this part, I want to discuss why I recommend it as a strategic direction for long-term care organizations.

With few exceptions, most long-term care providers are very focused on the delivery of excellent care, meeting regulations, and not exceeding their expense and capital budgets.  While I acknowledge that there are some firms that say they are looking to reach beyond these three basic objectives, they wouldn't deny that these three provide for the foundation to do the other things.  Unlike their siblings in acute care, they rarely have large endowments granted for testing or expanding the technology within the organization.

Until recently, the use of technology in long-term care was driven mostly by the regulators.   A regulation would be issued and facilities would find themselves hard-pressed to meet it without the addition of some kind of technology.  There are many examples of this that came into the operation since about 1999 such as the MDS and PPS.   While there are always manual ways to meet the requirement, doing so becomes next to impossible.  When MDS 2 was introduced, the government provided, free of charge, the RAVEN system to allow providers to obtain and use technology to meet their requirements.  And many did.  Many still use these tools today.  But the underlying message is that long-term care embraced technology, for the most part, because they had too.

On the heels of the changes in the regulations, in particular those that affect the way a long-term care facility is compensated, came vendors offering technology tools that can help the providers better capture the details of their services, and therefore potentially increase their reimbursements.  This financial motive drove the introduction of technology on a larger scale into these facilities, most of which were in no way prepared to fully utilize it.

Since the turn of the millennium we've seen a fairly steady movement of vendors entering the long-term marketplace and offering technology that claims to be able to improve just about everything that goes on in a long-term care facility. Regardless as to whether software is hosted on the Internet, or self hosted, the amount of hardware, software, and network resources required to run it has grown dramatically.

These additional resources within the facility now demand attention to keep them running properly.   They also use electricity, floor space, desk space, and air conditioning.  This adds cost, time, and full time employees just to service the hardware, software, and networks upon which long-term care now requires to fulfill its very mission.  In this process, long-term care facilities have done the best they can. Nevertheless, they really can't pour the amount of dollars into the technology and support personnel to run things at the same level of accomplishment as they do their healthcare facility.   There's just not enough budget to go around.  So back to the mission, they must focus on providing excellent care first.

One way to lessen the technology load while not lessening the technology advantage is to get rid of the hardware and software, and much of the network it needs. Instead, move to the model that provides the technology computing they need without placing it onsite, or at least reduce the amount of on-premises technology.  

Right now many of my colleagues in IT are gasping at my suggestion. They think I've gone mad.  But I strongly believe that for long-term care -- now facing the next large regulatory imposition in EHR -- Near Zero Footprint is where they need to be.  As they can move their focus from the "technology infrastructure" they can increase their focus on healthcare.  As they reduce the size of the footprint, they will also reduce the cost to run it.  

I look out ten years and can envision a day when a long-term care facility can run its business and provide better care with a few network closets, a handful of routers and switches, and a collection of wireless devices both fixed and mobile.

It's the other end of the bell curve!
