In some form or another, I've done software consulting since before I was in college.  I can still remember the excitement of my first contract:  I was paid $600 to develop a website for a waste management company.  Being 16 at the time, I was incredibly excited not just to create software professionally but to also be paid well.  Over the following three months, I developed a friendship with that client and we continued doing business for years to come.  It always felt like we were one company, not separate entities.  

Of course, not every client wants to have a close working relationship.  And while rare, sometimes it's in a consultant's best interest to maintain some distance.  Still, the biggest successes that we've found in consulting have been when we get to work closely with a client and establish some level of friendship - and more importantly - trust.

It goes without saying but you don't gain a client's trust in a day, and with software, there are many factors that go into establishing it.  In this post, I'd like to cover some of the initial steps we take in building said trust.  We do this by answering the five Ws for the client:  who, what, where, when, and why.

<h3>1.  Who</h3>
Besides 'when' which we will get to, answering 'who' is one of the biggest questions you can answer for a client.  They may say that they don't care who is doing the work, but for any project that extends past a few weeks, this is a key question to answer.  If you are planning on using a 3rd party, partner, offshore, or hiring a part-time 'consultant', the client should know up front.  The client may rarely interact with these resources if at all, but it still matters.  Clients appreciate honesty and we've found that they always like to know who is building their key software assets.  If you need to use a 3rd party for design, let the client know.  Explain to them why as well.  For example, maybe you have great synergies with certain designers, or maybe you know someone who specializes in an area the client wants to focus on. Just a brief introduction of all the resources will go a long way.

<h3>2.  What</h3>
This may seem obvious, but I've seen consultants screw this up several times.  Explain to the client what you will be delivering.  You both have a general idea, but it's a very good idea to have something in writing stating what components will be delivered with a project.  The 'what' might be a functional specification, it might be a project plan, or it could be some combination of both as well as other resources.  On top of that, I highly recommend including some documents that explain what technologies you have used.  Not only is this useful for maintenance, but it also helps the client do some research into what's powering the business/project.  

Another key aspect of the 'what' is cost.  I cannot stress this enough:  be upfront and honest about the client's costs.  Answer what the development costs will be to the client, what hosting costs will be, what licensing costs will be, maintenance costs, etc.  The more specific you can be here, the better.  When I meet with potential clients, I try to give them a general feel for our costs early on.  Nobody wins if you get three weeks into discussions only to find out that the client was thinking $5000 when you were thinking $50,000.

One final note on this - answering what will be delivered is key to knowing when a project is done.  Software is a living thing that needs consistent attention, but it's key to define when an engagement ends.  Without that end, you cannot move on to focus on new areas of a project and managing expectations becomes exponentially more difficult.

<h3>3.  Where</h3>
'Where' covers a variety of important topics that you should answer for a client.  Where is the software going to be hosted?  Where is the source code being stored?  Where will meetings be?  If you're an engineer, you may be thinking that it's silly to disclose what type of source control you are using.  It's definitely not silly.  More than once, we've come into projects where a development firm went under and the client had no idea where the latest code was. It's a nightmare, and it could have easily been solved if that firm had told the client, "We are using SVN hosted on server SVR-ABC."  

<h3>4.  Why</h3>
It's pretty rare that you take on a project where the client already has answers to all the questions and they have a technology plan as well.  The majority of the time, you are going to be making some decisions that will impact the project long-term.  Let's say you're doing a mobile app and you choose to use Cordova instead of building native.  The client needs to know why you made this decision as it can have long-term implications (i.e. it's not 'native' in the truest sense).  What are the benefits of Cordova?  What are the drawbacks?  Why is this a good decision? 

Even before technology is chosen, 'why' is one of the first questions you want to answer for a client.  Why should they choose your firm over someone else?  Why are you the best choice for executing on this project?

<h3>5.  When</h3>
I pushed 'when' to the very end.  It's the question that every client wants answered, and the previous four Ws play into it.  You know what's coming:  when will the project be delivered?  When a project kicks off, you should (must) have a plan that sets milestone dates as well as a delivery date.  Those dates need to be realistic based on what you know about the project.  If a project hits a snag and the dates need to move, you must revisit the 'when' and answer it honestly again and as early as possible.  Waiting until a date is missed to tell the client that a project is going to be late is a recipe for disaster.  Coming back to the trust factor, most clients can understand delays if they are warned early (and there aren't many).  Trying to soften the blow of a delay by hiding things will break your client's trust in you.  

<h3>Wrapping It Up</h3>
Even if you do everything above, it all will boil down to execution.  If you are delivering and the client is seeing results, a trust will be built.  With consulting, like everything else, honesty is the best policy.  Building strong relationships with clients pays dividends.  As a consultant, the client will most likely come back in the future not to mention recommend you to others.  As a client, you now have someone you can depend on to build products that suit your business needs.  It truly is win-win.
