<img src="/assets/thinking.png" class="right padded-left" alt="Garland" itemprop="image"> When early-20th Century business philosopher Napoleon Hill said “Action is the real measure of intelligence,” he voiced a point that echoes even more loudly today. The 21st Century seems filled with bright, well-informed, electronically interconnected people who too willingly settle for just looking intelligent. Operating in an undemanding world of intermediate work products, they circularly review, criticize, and refine each other’s’ stuff, always diligently gestating without ever quite delivering.

Everyone’s busy, it seems, but nothing’s getting done.

Some organizations consistently execute on their strategies with discipline and near-military precision. Others find ways to cultivate and capitalize on miraculous flashes of innovative brilliance.

Many more organizations, however, become bogged down in the diligent pursuit of narrowly defined perfection. “Due Diligence,” they call it, but when does due diligence become don’t diligence? What does it take to spark an organizational shift from activity to action?

<span itemprop="description">Execution, delivering on the promise of an organization’s strategy, is the central challenge of modern leadership. Some organizations “have it,” but many don’t, and the difference lies in a fearlessly deep dive into six basic questions</span>:

1.	As an organization, how do we make decisions? How do we translate our decisions into results?
2.	What motivates our people? Are we doing all we can to harness their motivation?
3.	How do we communicate within our organization? What do we spend most of our time talking about?
4.	Does the reporting structure in our organization preserve and protect positions of power? Or do we apply authority to accomplish our objectives?
5.	How do we express our organization’s goals? How do we enlist, engage, and direct our employees in their pursuit?
6.	How do we measure, recognize, and celebrate our success, so that succeeding becomes the rule rather than the exception?

By scientifically chasing down the root-cause answers to these questions, organizations can learn to become more effective in executing strategy. Perhaps a change in leadership may be warranted, or an evolution of the organization’s culture, values, or recognition/rewards systems. Maybe the members of the organization need to learn how to work more effectively together.

When an organization – your organization – chooses to make the crucial shift from merely doing things to actually getting things done, where does the transformation begin?

Incrementally speaking, it's clear that technology boosts productivity. Information Technology's ever-evolving arsenal of productivity tools facilitate and streamline our work and interconnect us in ways that seems to improve every day.

But major game-changing breakthroughs come from psychology, not technology. Give an intrinsically motivated and engaged free thinker a quill and parchment and watch her run circles around a siloed bureaucrat equipped with a Surface Pro running Windows 8.1.
