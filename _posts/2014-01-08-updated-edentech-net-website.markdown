This isn't a very long post, but I wanted to kick off 2014 by mentioning several new sections on the Edentech website.  These sections include:

* [Opensourceen Source][opensource]
* [Salesforce.com][salesforce]
* [Mobile Development][mobile]
* [Microsoft][microsoft]
* [Data Storage][datastores]

These new areas go into more detail about the consulting services we provide.  One area in particular that I'd like to call attention to is Salesforce.com.  As of this past week, we are now officially Salesforce.com Certified Developers and also a Certified Partner.  We're very excited about this as we've been using the platform for some time, and we are also avid Heroku users.  

If you have any questions or are interested in learning more, feel free to [contact us][contact].  Happy 2014!
