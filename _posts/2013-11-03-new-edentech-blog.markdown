It's been a long time coming, but I'm incredibly happy to present the new, and first, Edentech Solutions Group Blog. 

Actually, we've been doing a lot of house cleaning lately.  Besides the launch of a new iOS app called [Twilink][twilink], we also completely rewrote the [Edentech website][edentech] and are working on new updates to Hourglass and Garland as well as their accompanying sites.  

When it comes to this particular site, we've decided to give [Jekyll][jekyll] a shot for content management.  The source code for this site is available on [Github][github] as well.  To get things started, we largely ported over the new Edentech site's CSS and markup.  

In terms of content, we plan to have posts about everything from software development to health care technology.  I'm hoping that we can even get Lou to post some content periodically!  Ultimately, the goal is going to be a post every week.

If you have any thoughts or content that you'd like to see posted, feel free to [contact us][contact] and let us know.
