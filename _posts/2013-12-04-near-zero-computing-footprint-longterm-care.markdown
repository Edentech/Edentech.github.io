<img src="/assets/globe.png" class="right padded-left" alt="Garland" itemprop="image">It's almost two years now that I've been endorsing the philosophy of "Near Zero Computing Footprint" for the long-term care industry.  To be honest about it, I've been recommending it in a broad range of health care providers, not just long-term care.  Why?  Having been a part of the technology provider businesses for over 30 years, many of my colleagues ask why I'd recommend a movement that is perceived by many as reducing the need for technology consultants and technology components.  Given the regulatory nature of Healthcare, isn't technology required?  Therefore, aren't the hardware and software and consultants required?

In this first post, I will begin the pursuit of answering the questions by starting with defining what is meant by "Near Zero Computing Footprint", and why long-term care?

Actually, "Near Zero Computing Footprint" is a concession.  I'd prefer it to be Zero Footprint Computing!  But we're not there yet.  The current state of the technology industry is moving quickly to the state where we can access mass amounts of data securely over wireless mobile devices.  It's not at the point just yet of replacing premises-based access methods that require more reliable and secured connections to the many clouds of data available to the health care industry today.  For now, Near Zero is about as good as it gets.

"Near Zero Computing Footprint" is the movement from the premises-based environment that houses computers and servers, networks and wiring, and all of the other paraphernalia required to process and access the data needed to successfully and legally manage a long-term care facility.  The philosophy is a movement or action, and not necessarily an end state.  It's a discipline by which a facility or an organization, evaluates their needs and requirements in light of what they have today, technology wise, and then makes decisions to meet their needs and objectives while reducing the footprint of what they have today. 

One example would be a single site long-term care facility that has 10 servers, 100 desktops, a local area network, and about 10 Terabytes of data. The site is currently entertaining an introduction of a new application or requirement that would add yet another server, a few more access devices like mobile tablets, and the need for another 1 terabyte of data.  We all know how this was addressed in the past, but utilizing the movement toward "Near Zero Computing Footprint" would have the facility looking at adding a much larger single server, installing it as a Virtual Host, and then virtualizing the server-side of the new application -- and three or four of the other legacy servers.  This one move would be a new reduction of three physical servers in the facility and a good start on the way to "Near Zero Computing Footprint."

Yet another approach to the same objective would be the external cloud approach.   Many vendors offering software solutions today are also offering the SaaS (Software as a Service) approach.  There's nothing new about this.  It's now re-branded as cloud-based, but it's the same thing.  They host the application, the computers, and the inbound connections.  You just have to provide the clients and a way to get there.  Following this approach for this example is effective in moving toward the "Near Zero Computing Footprint", tallying a net reduction of one server in the facility.  This approach doesn't move you there as quickly as you may think and hoped for, but it does move you there.

When opting for the cloud-hosted approach, the facility or organization needs to be extremely careful in their selection and think it through very carefully.  While this is a form of outsourcing- - that is, you're outsourcing the responsibility of running the equipment, housing the data, and more -- you can never outsource the responsibility for your data or your compliance with regulations.  The vendor you choose must provide you with the assurances required around the access to, the protection of, and the overall ability of their platform to meet your objectives and business requirements.

Lastly in choosing an approach, there is always a cost consideration.  Cloud vendors always sound less expensive, and "sometimes" they are.  That means that sometimes they're not, too.  You need to do the work to understand the short and long-term financial impact on your organization.

Either way, you're on your journey riding the express to the "Near Zero Computing Footprint".  Next time, I'll get more into the "Why long-term care?"
